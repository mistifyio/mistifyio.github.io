{"name":"mistify.io","tagline":"The Lightwieght Cloud Construction Kit","body":"# What Is Mistify?\r\nMistify is a lightweight, opinionated system for deploying cloud infrastructure. It combines a purpose built Linux distribution with Go based server orchestration tools.\r\n\r\n# How Does Mistify Work?\r\nMistify uses a custom Linux distribution built with cloud operability in mind. With MistifyOS you get a ZFS filesystem, KVM and Docker compatible lightweight containers, KTrace for system analysis, and SystemD for more programmable management.\r\n\r\nTo complete the system, we have API based orchestration to manage VM's within your cloud. Our Go based services included clustered support that automagically keeps track of new hardware as you grow your cloud infrastructure.\r\n\r\nFor more information, be sure to check out our [documentation repo](https://github.com/mistifyio/docs) and [the MistifyOS repo ](https://github.com/mistifyio/mistify-os).\r\n\r\n# Who Is Behind Mistify?\r\nMistify is primarily developed by engineers at OmniTI, with contributions from various members of the open source community. If you are into Linux kernel hacking and want to improve the state of Linux containers or ZFS on Linux, [OmniTI is hiring](http://omniti.com/is/hiring).\r\n\r\n# Stay Involved\r\nAs a new open source project, we welcome contributors from all areas; OS hackers, Go devs, Documentation folks, website help; all are welcome! If you are interested in testing out Mistify, please join us on freenode on #mistify. Also, you can [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mistifyio).\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-2585213-8","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
